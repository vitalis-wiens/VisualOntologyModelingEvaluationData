# VisualOntologyModelingEvaluationData
A Comparative User Evaluation on Visual Ontology Modeling Using Node-Link Diagrams Evaluation Data

*It is a complementary repository for a complete evaluation data based on the research conducted for comparing Visual Ontology Modeling Tool Using Node-Link Diagrams with Indented Tree Hierarchical Interfaces* 

Following is the result recorded based on the tasks that users performed:

## T1: The participants had to fill out a demographic questionnaire, stating their name, age, profession, experience in ontology modeling, experience with Protégé and WebVOWL, and any sort of visual, physical, or color blind impairment.



## T2: Using Protégé, the participants had to model an ontology for the Family Tree Space or the City Traffic Space.

## T3: Based on the modeled concept space of the task T2, the participants had to fill out an After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) as a post task.

## T4: The participants had to highlight the concepts as a cued recall process in a table of 6 × 4 with twenty four concepts, which they think they have modeled using Protégé.

## T5: Based on the modeled concept space of the task T2, the participants had to fill out a Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) as a post study task. 

## T6: Using WebVOWL Editor, the participants had to model an ontology for the Family Tree Space or the City Traffic Space.

## T7: Based on the modeled concept space of the task T6, the participants had to fill out an ASQ questionnaire as a post task.

## T8: The participants had to highlight the concepts as a cued recall process in a table of 6 × 4 with twenty four concepts, which they think they modeled using WebVOWL Editor.

## T9: Based on the modeled concept space of the task T6, the participants had to fill out a CSUQ questionnaire as a post task.
